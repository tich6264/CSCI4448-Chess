# Closet Bot
Object-Oriented Analysis & Design, Fall 2016 [CSCI 4448]

Closet Bot is an application that allows users to add and tag different articles of clothing into their “closet”. Based on what is in a given user’s closet and specified user conditions (for instance, “winter”), the app will generate a collection of outfits for you that you can then save if desired to an outfit closet.

### Goal
Design & implement an application in an object-oriented language while following object-oriented analysis & design practices, including
- gathering requirements (use cases, user requirements)
- UML (activity, class, sequence diagrams)
- design patterns
